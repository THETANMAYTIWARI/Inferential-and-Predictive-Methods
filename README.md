## Project Title
Inferential and Predictive Methods

## Introduction
This project explores inferential and predictive methods using Python, focusing on analyzing payroll data. The code demonstrates various statistical techniques, including hypothesis testing, linear regression, decision tree classification, and logistic regression.

## Code Overview
The Python script included in this repository performs data analysis on payroll data, covering data cleansing, outlier removal, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling. It utilizes libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and scikit-learn to implement these techniques.

## Future Work
Future work on this project could involve exploring more advanced machine learning techniques, such as ensemble methods or deep learning, to improve predictive accuracy. Additionally, incorporating external datasets or demographic information could provide deeper insights into the factors influencing payroll and benefit costs.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of inferential and predictive methods in analyzing payroll data. While the analysis provided valuable insights into salary trends and predictive modeling, further refinement and exploration are needed to improve model performance and uncover additional patterns in the data.
